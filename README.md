## Authors

## Getting started
Begin by installing NodeJS from https://nodejs.org/en/.<br>
Once successfully installed, you should be able to run the command `npm -v` from a terminal.<br>
We are using NodeJS 10.11.0 and NPM 6.4.1.<br>
<br>
Open a terminal in the current directory and run `npm install` to install our project dependencies.<br>
To transpile and execute our code, run the command `npm start`.<br>
Our bot will then interact with the competition server and print out the commands being run.
